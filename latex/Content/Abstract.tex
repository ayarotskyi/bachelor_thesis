Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be a powerful tool for autonomous vehicle control. This approach enables a vehicle to learn driving behavior by mimicking expert demonstrations and effectively mapping raw sensor inputs, such as camera images, to control actions like steering and acceleration. By using deep learning techniques, CNNs can extract relevant features from visual data so that the vehicle can generalize across different driving scenarios.

This thesis investigates the architecture, training process and performance evaluation of CNN-based models trained by imitation learning and demonstrates their potential and limitations in real-world autonomous obstacle course driving applications. It also delves into the process of collecting the data for the training and image preprocessing algorithms. At the core of the system is a car-shaped JetBot robot with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) oriented board from NVIDIA. The main goal of the thesis is to contribute to the research of Imitation Learning in the domain of autonomous driving.
