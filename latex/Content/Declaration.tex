\addchap{Declaration of Authorship}
I do solemnly declare that I have written the presented research thesis:

\begin{center}
  \textit{\glqq\titel\grqq}\\[1em]
\end{center}

by myself without undue help from a second person others and without using such tools
other than that specified. Where I have used thoughts from external sources, directly or
indirectly, published or unpublished, this is always clearly attributed. I am aware that
infringement can also subsequently lead to the cancellation of the degree.
